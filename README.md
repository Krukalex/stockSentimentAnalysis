Predicting stock prices using sentiment analysis

**Research Question**
It seems logical to assume that there is some relationship between the performance of finacial markets and the attitude of finacial news and the general public. In this project, I will attempt to model that relationship. There are a few questions that I would like to answer with this project, and it will be divided into two sections. The first section will be focused on statistical inference, and will examine the null hypothesis that news sentiment has no relationship with the performance of the S&P 500. If we are able to reject this null hypothesis, we will move into the second part, in which I will attempt to develop a time series model to predict changes in the S&P 500 using the sentiment analysis from major news sources
